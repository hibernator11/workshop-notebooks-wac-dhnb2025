[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hibernator11/workshop-notebooks-wac-dhnb2025/HEAD)

Examples of code based on Jupyter Notebooks to extract Web Archive Content to create collections as data. This examples facilitate the extraction and reuse of datasets of text extracted from all available captures of archived web pages. The datasets can be employed to analyse changes over time and to identify the most relevant words.

This project has been developed as part of the workshop "Web Archives Collections as data" for the [DHNB 2025 conference](https://dhnb.eu/conferences/dhnb2025/workshops/web-archive-collections-as-data/).

The coordinators of the workshop are:

- Olga Holownia , International Internet Preservation Consortium
- Gustavo Candela, University of Alicante, Spain
- Helena Byrne, British Library, UK
- Jon Carlstedt Tønnessen, National Library of Norway, Norway
- Anders Klindt Myrvoll, Royal Danish Library, Denmark 
- Sophie Ham, National Library of the Netherlands, Netherlands
- Steven Claeyssens, National Library of the Netherlands, Netherlands 

## Digital collections
This datasets used in this workshop are the following Web Archives:

- [Australian Web Archive](https://web.archive.org.au/awa/)
- [UK Government Web Archive](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/)

## Notebooks
This project contains the following Jupyter Notebooks:

- Extraction of text from the Australian Web Archive: [getting_text_from_web_pages_AWA](https://nbviewer.org/github/hibernator11/workshop-notebooks-wac-dhnb2025/blob/main/notebooks/getting_text_from_web_pages_AWA.ipynb)
- Extraction of text from the UK Government: [getting_text_from_web_pages_UK](https://nbviewer.org/github/hibernator11/workshop-notebooks-wac-dhnb2025/blob/main/notebooks/getting_text_from_web_pages_UK.ipynb)
- Reusing the extracted text from the Australian Web Archive: [reusing_downssteams_AWA](https://nbviewer.org/github/hibernator11/workshop-notebooks-wac-dhnb2025/blob/main/notebooks/reusing_downssteams_AWA.ipynb)
- Using advanced functionalities: [getting_text_from_web_pages_advanced_AWA](https://nbviewer.org/github/hibernator11/workshop-notebooks-wac-dhnb2025/blob/main/notebooks/getting_text_from_web_pages_advanced_AWA.ipynb)

These examples are based on and have been adapted from the code provided by the [GLAM Workbench](https://glam-workbench.net/), in particular in the Web Archive section.

 ## Running the notebooks
**To execute the notebook in Binder:**

- Click the launch binder button above. Once the demo launches, click My_sample_notebook.ipynb in the file listing.
- Run the notebook by selecting Cell > Run All. You call also click the play button to run the notebook cell by cell. You will the output of each cell.
- You can edit the cells, and click on play to run and see the changes.
